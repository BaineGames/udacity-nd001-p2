Project 2: Memory Game for Udacity Nano-degree Front End Web Developer

Icons updated to use Font Awesome latest version 5.5.0. 

The game randomly selects 8 icons from the brands offered in the Font Awesome pack and uses those to set the game cards.

# How to play
To start playing, just click on any card to start the timer. The goal is to find matching pairs. 
If the pair is not matching, they will go back to being hidden.
If the pair is matching, they will stay visible and be green.
You have unlimited amount of time. 

Once you have found all matching pairs, you will see your stats rating you with 0 to 3 stars and the time it took you to complete. From there you have options to play again with another random set of icons.
